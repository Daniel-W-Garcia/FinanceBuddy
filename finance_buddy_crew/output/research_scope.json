Lite header page: strictly valid JSON/YAML fields with explicit placeholders and a note that examples must be replaced before publication. Full appendix: methods, formulas, QA checklists, glossary, and workflows. Executive summary: include a concise 5–7 sentence example paragraph labeled clearly as EXAMPLE ONLY, to show end-state output format (do not publish examples in final analysis). Required sections and contents: 1) Fundamentals (TTM/LTM): Use the latest four fiscal quarters; provide revenue, gross profit/margin, operating income/margin, net income, GAAP diluted EPS, adjusted EPS (only if company discloses), EBITDA/Adj. EBITDA (if disclosed), operating cash flow, capex, free cash flow, cash/equivalents, total debt, net cash/(net debt), lease liabilities, inventory (ending/average), inventory turns, DIO, DPO, CCC, store count and net change LTM, square footage (if disclosed), e-commerce mix %, category mix notes. Normalize across fiscal calendars using each issuer’s TTM; footnote timing differences. Include a quarterly seasonality chart for GME. 2) Recent News: Cover last 90 days comprehensively and material LTM events. Categorize (Corporate actions/Capital markets; Strategy/Operations; Legal/Regulatory; Market/Technical incl. halts/short-interest). Each item requires headline, one-line impact tag, source URL, publication timestamp with timezone, access timestamp, and confirmation status. Exclude rumors/unverified social media. 3) Price Performance and Technicals: Show absolute and relative total returns over 1M/3M/6M/12M vs SPY and an equal-weight locked peer basket; optionally include XRT with clear labeling. Include drawdowns with event annotations. Provide risk/vol metrics: 252d annualized volatility, 252d beta vs SPY, LTM max drawdown, and 95% historical daily VaR. Disclose vendor, timestamps, and method. Short interest: show % of float and days-to-cover with official exchange/FINRA as-of dates, float source, and methodology; include any exchange-published trading halts with canonical links. 4) Key Risks: Categorize into Business, Financial, Operational, Market/Technical, and Disclosure/Governance. For each risk, define one or more observable indicators, monitoring thresholds, and current status (green/yellow/red) with dates and sources. Appendix must include: a) Identifier source-of-truth and reconciliation log (EDGAR primary; vendor secondary) with sign-off; b) Update cadence/SLA, ownership, and handoffs per section; c) QA checklist with pass/fail gates for peer basket, timestamps/timezone validation, and citation completeness; d) Short glossary (e.g., DIO, CCC, TRI, days-to-cover) to reduce ambiguity; e) Explicit formulas and example calculations for days-to-cover and total return (dividend handling), float-source guidance; f) Cap-table/share-count tie-out checklist (ATM issuances, buybacks, splits) with order of precedence; g) GAAP vs IFRS normalization notes for any non-US peers (exclude or adjust explicitly); h) Peer-basket TRI construction details (rebalance cadence, corporate-action handling) and minimal pseudocode; i) Timezone/DST handling with canonical library reference and timestamp validation rule; j) Identifier validation step (CIK/ISIN/CUSIP) against EDGAR and a secondary vendor at each update cycle; k) Filled sample row for News log and Risks register (labeled EXAMPLE ONLY). Pseudocode/methods: - Annualized daily volatility (252d) = stdev(daily_returns) * sqrt(252). - Beta vs SPY (252d) = cov(GME_returns, SPY_returns) / var(SPY_returns) using overlapping dates. - Historical VaR (95% daily) = 5th percentile of daily returns over last 252 trading days (report negative %). - Max drawdown (LTM) = min(TRI/rolling_peak − 1) over LTM window. - Days-to-cover = short_interest_shares / avg_daily_volume (define ADV window, disclose). - Total return index: start at 100; TRI_t = TRI_{t-1} * (1 + price_return_t + dividend_t/price_{t-1}); use split-adjusted series and reinvest dividends. Peer basket rules: locked equal-weight basket; rebalance monthly or on corporate actions; corporate actions handled via vendor adjustment factors; document effective dates.","constraints":["Timeframe strictly LTM/TTM: use the most recent four fiscal quarters; state covered_period_start, covered_period_end, and as_of_timestamp_ET on page 1; compute dynamically, do not hardcode.","Primary sources for fundamentals: SEC 10-K/10-Q/8-K, earnings call transcripts, and company IR; reconcile any third-party data to filings and footnote differences.","Identifiers: Use EDGAR as source-of-truth for CIK/ISIN/CUSIP; validate identifiers each update cycle against a secondary vendor; track reconciliation log with sign-off.","Currency: USD.
